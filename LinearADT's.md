# Linear ADT's 

Linear ADT's are data strucures where the elements follow a sequential order.

The Primary Linear ADT's are:

  - Array
  - Stack
  - Linked list
  - Queue

## Arrays

![arrays_v1_202x220](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4341a8cc-5ea4-41ea-8b97-3556057deb6d)

An array is a fixed size data structure with elements stored in contigous memeory locations
Operations: Access, Delete, Insert and Traverse

## Linked lists

![Singlelinkedlist](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f34aab8-438f-4b4a-8ba4-764eaf7157a7)

A linked list is a collection of nodes where each node contains data and a reference to the next node.

<ins> Types: </ins>
  - Singly linked list: each node points to the next node
  - Double linked list: Each node point to both the next and previous node
  - Circular Linked List: The last node points to the first node

Operations: Insert, delete, traverse.

## Stacks

A stack is a data structure that follows a Last In First Out (LIFO) principle
Operation: Push, Pop, Peek, isEmpty, isFull.

## Queues

A Queue is a data structure that follows a First In First Out (FIFO) principle.

<ins> Types: </ins>
  - Simple Queue: Basic FIFO Queue
  - Circular Queue: The last position is connected back to the first position
  - Priority Queue: Elements are removed based on priority.
  - Double-ended Queue (Deque): Insert and remove elements from both ends.

Operations: Enqueue, Dequeue, front, isEmpty, isFull
